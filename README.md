# Analytical-Platform-for-eCommerce-Store-using-AWS
## Business Overview
Ecommerce analytics is the process of collecting data from all of the sources that affect
a certain shop. Analysts can then utilize this information to deduce changes in customer
behavior and online shopping patterns. Ecommerce analytics spans the whole customer
journey, from discovery through acquisition, conversion, and eventually retention and
support.
In this project, I will use an eCommerce dataset to simulate the logs of user
purchases, product views, cart history, and the user’s journey on the online platform to
create two analytical pipelines, Batch and Real-time. The Batch processing will involve
data ingestion, Lake House architecture, processing, visualization using Amazon
Kinesis, Glue, S3, and QuickSight to draw insights regarding the following:
- Unique visitors per day
- During a certain time, the users add products to their carts but don’t buy them
- Top categories per hour or weekday (i.e. to promote discounts based on trends)
- To know which brands need more marketing
The Real-time channel involves detecting Distributed denial of service (DDoS) and Bot
attacks using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, and AWS SNS.
## Data Pipeline
A data pipeline is a technique for transferring data from one system to another. The data
may or may not be updated, and it may be handled in real-time (or streaming) rather
than in batches. The data pipeline encompasses everything from harvesting or
acquiring data using various methods to storing raw data, cleaning, validating, and
transforming data into a query-worthy format, displaying KPIs, and managing the above
process.
## Dataset Description
This dataset contains user behavioral information from a large multi-category online
store along with fields such as event_time, event_type, product_id, price, user_id. Each
row in the file represents one of the following event types:
- View
- Cart
- Removed from Cart
- Purchase

## Amazon S3
Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides manufacturing scalability, data
availability, security, and performance. Users may save and retrieve any quantity of data
using Amazon S3 at any time and from any location.
## AWS Glue
A serverless data integration service makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine
data for analytics, machine learning, and application development. It runs Spark/Python
code without managing Infrastructure at a nominal cost. You pay only during the run
time of the job. Also, you pay storage costs for Data Catalog objects. Tables may be
added to the AWS Glue Data Catalog using a crawler. The majority of AWS Glue users
employ this strategy. In a single run, a crawler can crawl numerous data repositories.
The crawler adds or modifies one or more tables in your Data Catalog after it's finished.
## AWS Athena
Athena is an interactive query service for S3 in which there is no need to load data, and
it stays in S3. It is serverless and supports many data formats, e.g., CSV, JSON, ORC,
Parquet, AVRO.
## Apache Flink
Flink is a scalable data analytics platform and distributed processing engine. Flink may
be used to handle massive data streams and give real-time analytical insights about the
processed data to your streaming application. Flink is built to work in a variety of cluster
setups, with in-memory calculations of any size. For distributed computations over data
streams, Flink also offers communication, fault tolerance, and data distribution. Flink
applications use unbounded or bounded data sets to process streams of events.
Unbounded streams have no fixed termination and are handled indefinitely. Bounded
streams have a defined beginning and endpoint and may be handled in batches.
## Amazon Kinesis
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a real-time data collection and processing service
from Amazon. Kinesis Data Streams apps are data-processing applications that may be
created. Kinesis Data Firehose is part of the Kinesis streaming data platform, which also
includes Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Video Streams, and Amazon Kinesis Data
Analytics. When using Kinesis Data Firehose, the user does not need to develop apps
or manage resources. Configure the data producers to send data to Kinesis Data
Firehose, and the data will be automatically transferred to the specified destination.
Kinesis Data Firehose may also be used to transform data before delivering it.
## QuickSight
Amazon QuickSight is a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered
business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud. It is the first BI service to offer
pay-per-session pricing, where you only pay when your users access their dashboards
or reports, making it cost-effective for large-scale deployments. It can connect to various
sources like Redshift, S3, Dynamo, RDS, files like JSON, text, CSV, TSV, Jira,
Salesforce, and on-premises oracle SQL-server.
## AWS Glue DataBrew
AWS Glue DataBrew is a visual data preparation tool that allows users to clean and
normalize data without writing any code. When compared to custom-created data
preparation, DataBrew helps minimize the time it takes to prepare data for analytics and
machine learning. Many pre-built transformations are available to automate data
preparation activities such as screening anomalies, transforming data to standard
formats, and rectifying erroneous values.
# Amazon DynamoDB
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed key-value NoSQL database service that
delivers quick and predictable performance while also allowing for seamless scaling.
DynamoDB relieves developers of the administrative responsibilities associated with
running and growing a distributed database. DynamoDB allows you to design database
tables that can store and retrieve any quantity of data while also serving any degree of
request volume. You may increase or decrease the throughput capacity of your tables
without experiencing downtime or performance reduction. Amazon DynamoDB supports
PartiQL, an open-source SQL-compatible query language that enables efficient data
querying independent of where or how it is stored.
